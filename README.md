# DiscordBot
Simple Discord bot for personal use with a focus on preventing feature creep as opposed to my old projects.
Will use [interactions.py](https://discord-py-slash-command.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ([Github repo](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py)) to evaluate this Discord wrapper.
